    We could use photography as a way to capture a moment in time, one where people wouldn't believe was captured or something
    that is breathtaking. Going to what was said in the text, it is mentioned how even tho a person is able to use a camera to capture
    that specific moment in time, they aren't able to actually preserve the memories/experience that one had during the captured moment so in one way
    yes they were able to keep that moment in time, but on the other, some parts aren't fully capable of saving through a photo.
    However, visually speaking we are able to capture whatever moment in time we want and we can use applications online to make it appear better than it was.
    With the help of photoshop we can enhance the visuals that were captured from the picture and then be able to make it look better than it did so that it can make the
    memory that was taken, appear to a different audience.

    With a camera we are able to take pictures of many moments in history that have meaning to us, anything that holds dear to us as well as to friends or family.
    It's a way to display how you view the world to other people and it can be the same for someone else and vice versa. The pictures and edis that are made are just one's perspective on how
    they experience the world. The text mentions how photography can shape the way we percieve reality, in the sense that we can be informed but also be mislead by them depending on the timing or
    framing of the shot. It's interesting to hear that because really a photograph depnding on the angle or the way it is taken can really change the way we percieve the world from that lens,
    from one shot we can see one thing while in another we can see something completely different and that is what is so interesting about photography because it can be beautiful but also misleading.
