    <div class="text">
      Picking up a camera and taking shots of different things I see around the city is something I never imagined myself
      doing however I became interested seeing other people's work and having the ability to be able to come into class and gain
      artistic knowledge as well as learning a bit of html is a bonus. I'd personally love to get into photoshop because I have used it before
      however it has been years since I have picked it up so coming back to it and learning it for a hobby can help me out in my future career. Overall,
      I hope to learn how to be able to properly use a camera and be able to take many pictures across the city
